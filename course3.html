This course series is one of the most enrolled in and highly rated course collections in this list. JHU did an incredible job with the balance of breadth and depth in the curriculum. One thing that’s included in this series that’s usually missing from many of data science courses is a complete section on statistics, which is the backbone to data science.

Overall, the Data Science specialization is an ideal mix of theory and application using the R programming language. As far as prerequisites go, you should have some programming experience (doesn’t have to be R) and you have a good understanding of Algebra. Previous knowledge of Linear Algebra and/or Calculus isn’t necessary, but it is helpful.
<br>
Price – Free or $49/month for certificate and graded materials<br>
Provider – Johns Hopkins University<br>

Curriculum:
<br>
The Data Scientist’s Toolbox<br>
R Programming<br>
Getting and Cleaning Data<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis<br>
Reproducible Research<br>
Statistical Inference<br>
Regression Models<br>
Practical Machine Learning<br>
Developing Data Products<br>
Data Science Capstone<br>
If you’re rusty with statistics and/or want to learn more R first, check out the Statistics with R Specialization as well.

<h2>2. <a href="https://www.https://www.thisismetis.com/courses/introduction-to-data-science?utm_source=LDS&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=LDS2019affiliate" style="text-decoration:none">Introduction to Data Science</a></h2> — Metis<br>

An extremely highly rated course — 4.9/5 on SwichUp and 4.8/5 on CourseReport — which is taught live by a data scientist from a top company. This is a six week long data science course that covers everything in the entire data science process, and it’s the only live online course in this list. Furthermore, not only will you get a certificate upon completion, but since this course also accredited, you’ll also receive continuing education units.

Two nights per week, you’ll join the instructor with other students to learn data science as if it was an online college course. Not only are you able to ask questions, but the instructor also spends extra time for office hours to further help those students that might be struggling.
<br>
Price — $750
<br>
The curriculum:
<br>
Computer Science, Statistics, Linear Algebra Short Course<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization<br>
Data Modeling: Supervised/Unsupervised Learning and Model Evaluation<br>
Data Modeling: Feature Selection, Engineering, and Data Pipelines<br>
Data Modeling: Advanced Supervised/Unsupervised Learning<br>
Data Modeling: Advanced Model Evaluation and Data Pipelines | Presentations<br>
For prerequisites, you’ll need to know Python, some linear algebra, and some basic statistics. If you need to work on any of these areas, Metis also has Beginner Python and Math for Data Science, a separate live online course just for learning the Python, Stats, Probability, Linear Algebra, and Calculus for data science.
<br>
<h2>3. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python?ranMID=40328&ranEAID=OyHlmBp2G0c&ranSiteID=OyHlmBp2G0c-HQsIOyfJhBbXCTUe5sFIgQ&siteID=OyHlmBp2G0c-HQsIOyfJhBbXCTUe5sFIgQ&utm_content=10&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=OyHlmBp2G0c" style="text-decoration:none">Applied Data Science with Python Specialization</a></h2> — UMich @ Coursera
<br>
University of Michigan, who also launched an online data science Master’s degree, produce this fantastic specialization focused the applied side of data science. This means you’ll get a strong introduction to commonly used data science Python libraries, like matplotlib, pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, and networkx, and learn how to use them on real data.

This series doesn’t include the statistics needed for data science or the derivations of various machine learning algorithms, but does provide a comprehensive breakdown of how to use and evaluate those algorithms in Python. Because of this, I think this would be more appropriate for someone that already knows R and/or is learning the statistical concepts elsewhere.

If you’re rusty with statistics, consider the Statistics with Python Specialization first. You’ll learn many of the most important statistical skills needed for data science.
<br>
Price – Free or $49/month for certificate and graded materials<br>
Provider – University of Michigan<br>

Courses:
<br>
Introduction to Data Science in Python<br>
Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python<br>
Applied Machine Learning in Python<br>
Applied Text Mining in Python<br>
Applied Social Network Analysis in Python<br>
To take these courses, you’ll need to know some Python or programming in general, and there actually a couple of great lectures in the first course dealing with some of the more advanced Python features you’ll need to process data effectively.
<br>
<h2>4. <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/?utm_source=learndatasci" style="text-decoration:none">Dataquest</a></h2>
<br>
Dataquest is a fantastic resource on its own, but even if you take other courses on this list, Dataquest serves as a superb complement to your online learning.

Dataquest foregos video lessons and instead teaches through an interactive textbook of sorts. Every topic in the data science track is accompanied by several in-browser, interactive coding steps that guide you through applying the exact topic you’re learning.

Video-based learning is more “passive” — it's very easy to think you understand a concept after watching a 2-hour long video, only to freeze up when you actually have to put what you've learned in action. — Dataquest FAQ
To me, Dataquest stands out from the rest of the interactive platforms because the curriculum is very well organized, you get to learn by working on full-fledged data science projects, and there’s a super active and helpful Slack community where you can ask questions.
<br>
The platform has one main data science learning curriculum for Python:
<br>
Data Scientist In Python Path
This track currently contains 31 courses, which cover everything from the very basics of Python, to Statistics, to the math for Machine Learning, to Deep Learning, and more. The curriculum is constantly being improved and updated for a better learning experience.
<br>
Price – 1/3 of content is Free, 29/monthforBasic,49/month for Premium
<br>
Here’s a condensed version of the curriculum:
<br>
Python - Basic to Advanced<br>
Python data science libraries - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more<br>
Visualization and Storytelling<br>
Effective data cleaning and exploratory data analysis<br>
Command line and Git for data science<br>
SQL - Basic to Advanced<br>
APIs and Web Scraping<br>
Probability and Statistics - Basic to Intermediate<br>
Math for Machine Learning - Linear Algebra and Calculus<br>
Machine Learning with Python - Regression, K-Means, Decision Trees, Deep Learning and more<br>
Natural Language Processing<br>
Spark and Map-Reduce<br>
Additionally, there’s also entire data science projects scattered throughout the curriculum. Each project’s goal is to get you to apply everything you’ve learned up to that point and to get you familiar with what it’s like to work on an end-to-end data science strategy.

Lastly, if you’re more interested in learning data science with R, then definitely check out Dataquest’s new Data Analyst in R path. The Dataquest subscription gives you access to all paths on their platform, so you can learn R or Python (or both!).

<br>
MicroMasters from edX are advanced, graduate-level courses that carry real credits you can apply to a select number of graduate degrees. The inclusion of probability and statistics courses makes this series from MIT a very well-rounded curriculum for being able to understand data intuitively.

Due to its advanced nature, you should have experience with single and multivariate calculus, as well as Python programming. There isn’t any introduction to Python or R like in some of the other courses in this list, so before starting the ML portion, they recommend taking Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python to get familiar with Python.
<br>
Price – Free or $1,350 for credential and graded materials<br>
Provider – University of Michigan<br>

Courses:
<br>
Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data<br>
Data Analysis in Social Science—Assessing Your Knowledge<br>
Fundamentals of Statistics<br>
Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning<br>
Capstone Exam in Statistics and Data Science<br>
The ML course has several interesting projects you’ll work on, and at the end of the whole series you’ll focus on one exam to wrap everything up.
